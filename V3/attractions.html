                        <p>Timmy and Tommy run the general store, Nook's Cranny. Not only can you find great deals here, this store will also purchase items from you! Talk to Timmy or Tommy to check their turnip buying prices. Their buying price changes every day. Get your turnips ready!</p>
                        <p>Able Sisters, a clothing store, is run by sisters Able and Mable. These two work hard sewing every piece of clothing they have in stock. They cycle through their collection each day, so check in daily! Partaking in Paradise fashion may help you fit in with the locals better.</p>

                        <h1>Museum</h1>
                        <p>The Paradise museum is a showcase of our island's abundant nature and world culture. These are many different sections that each have their own theme.</p>
                        <p>Our collection of bugs is vast and varied. We have bugs that take refuge in the trees, ones that swim, even some that burrow underground. The pride of our bug section is the butterfly room.</p>
                        <p>We have a section for fossils, of which we have many. As you walk further into section, you will learn about how all of these different ancient creatures evolved.</p>
                        <p>Paradise hosts a large number of different species of fish. From fresh water to salt water, we have taken measures to preserve these species in our museum. We even have deep sea fish, which are very difficult to see in a natural setting.</p>
                        <p>The last, and newest, section of the museum is our section for works of art. We do not know of how these paintings were acquired. What we do know is that all of the paintings in our museum have been verified to be 100% genuine.</p>
                        <p>As our museum collection is not complete, it would always be welcome to help out the preservation of nature and culture by donating your findings. Inquire with Blathers if you believe you may have something worth displaying.</p>
